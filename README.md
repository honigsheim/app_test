You just have to run the project.

In the project directory, you have to run:

### `npm install`

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock or shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, with an npm-shrinkwrap.json taking precedence if both files exist. See package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.

### `php artisan serve`


Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
